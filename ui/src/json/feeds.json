    "intro_html": "<p>\nLocated halfway between Edmonds and Mukilteo, this is a good place to listen to central Puget Sound. You may hear sounds from marine life like killer whales, seals, and possibly humpback or gray whales. You will also hear human-made noise from ferries, vessels passing through Possession Sound, and even trains! (Tracks run along the top of the beach here, only 100m from the hydrophone).\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA single hydrophone was first deployed in fall 2021 and redeployed in winter 2022 and spring 2023 by securing it to the base of an intertidal ladder on the southwest corner of the wharf at a depth of about -0.5 meters (relative to mean lowest low tidal height).

Thanks to Jeffrey and the Beach Camp staff for repairing the severe damage from the windstorm last fall.</p>",

Within a few months, the long cable failed so we re-deployed hydrophones at the outer edge of the wharf, attaching them to the base of pilings (depth 1m, so they dry at some negative tides and you may then hear bird sounds).  \n\nThe Bush Point node is hosted by <a href=\"https://orcanetwork.org/\">Orca Network</a> with support from Bush Point Wharf and WhidbeyTel.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.orcasound.net/portfolio/bush-point-hydrophone/\">Learn more about the Bush Point node</a></p>\n\nStatus update 6/1/2023: The Bush Point wharf was badly damaged over the winter of 2022-23 and is currently being assessed for repair.

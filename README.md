This repo specifies the web backend and frontend for the [Orcasound app](http://live.orcasound.net) that plays a live audio stream through the user's browser of choice. The backend is an [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) app using the [Phoenix framework](https://phoenixframework.org/). The frontend is built in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

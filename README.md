# Orcasound Dashboard Prototype

This is a UX and engineering contribution to Orcasound, an open-source platform that streams real-time underwater audio from hydrophones in the Salish Sea to detect and protect orcas.

Iâ€™ve been volunteering with the Orcasound team since 2023, focused on improving the experience for listeners, scientists, and volunteers who report orca detections. This prototype reimagines the reporting interface and proposes a scalable, data-rich dashboard for reviewing past detections, integrating AI models, and surfacing patterns that inform conservation.

**Live prototype:** [https://orcasound-dashboard.vercel.app/moderator](https://orcasound-dashboard.vercel.app/moderator)

**Tech stack:** Next.js, React, Typescript, Material UI 

## Designs in progress

Before -- the existing app looks like this. On the left is a list of hydrophone locations. Users can stream the audio live, and submit a report when they hear an interesting sound such as a whale, ship, or other. On the right is a list of user-submitted reports.

After -- in my redesign, I focused on resolving the following user pain points:
* Difficult to navigate from the home screen to the Reports page.
* No filter/search functions.
* The way it groups reports into "candidates" creates disjointed segments of audio.
* Doesn't pull relevant data from other sources.
Users need to quickly see where periods of activity are, so they can find and hear whale sounds.
